## Automate extraction of study notes from `WhatsApp Images`

We all end up with hell lot of _images to be deleted_ at the end of each semester. I've trained a CNN model to predict such images and extract them out of WhatsApp Images directory :)

like this: 

<img src="behind_the_scenes/image.jpeg" width="300px" height="500px" />

Images in red circles are notes which you may wanna delete or extract them to a folder (in case you are a maggu :P) and blue circles are important ones which shouldn't be messed up with.

Requirements:

* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io)

Instructions:

Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Connect your Smartphone to your system, mount `Internal Storage` and copy the absolute path to the WhatsApp folder, to know the absolute path open a terminal in `WhatsApp` folder and run `pwd` command. Run the `extract.py` script by `python extract.py` and paste the copied path when asked to. The script will create a new folder named `notes` in your `WhatsApp Image` folder and move the study notes images to it.

I've trained the model on about 1000 images and using Keras' data augmentation pipeline. Currently the model is 85% accurate on my dataset. Please feel free to add your own data and train the model on it to make the model more accurate. To add your own data, create a `data` folder in `behind_the_scenes` folder, create two subfolders `1` and `0` inside `data`, in `1` put study notes and put all other important images in `0`. See `behind_the_scenes` folder for more info.

Feel free to open up an issue if you wanna contribute or know something about this project.

Enjoy!
